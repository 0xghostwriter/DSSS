Damn Small SQLi Scanner (DSSS) has been made as a PoC where I wanted to show that commercial (SQLi) scanners can be beaten under 100 lines of code.

It supports blind/error SQLi tests, depth 1 crawling and advanced comparison of different response attributes to distinguish blind responses. If you are satisfied with your commercial tool scanning results then I believe that you could even be more satisfied with this one.

Currently only GET parameters are supported as of code line restrictions.
